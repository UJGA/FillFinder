- **Recent Activity:** View the most recent reports of Adderall availability.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive design for ease of use.

## How It Works

1. **Search:** Enter your location to find nearby pharmacies.
2. **View Reports:** See recent reports of Adderall availability at these pharmacies.
